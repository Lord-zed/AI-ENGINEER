# Explaining the output of the below program
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"{num1} == {num2} : {num1 == num2}")
print(f"{num1} != {num2} : {num1 != num2}")

print(f"{num1} < {num2} : {num1 < num2}")

# The first output is giving the answer as false, this is because the operation to be performed is a comparison operation(Equal to ), the first number is not equal to the second number.
# The 2nd output is giving the answer True, this is because the operation to be carried out is Not equal to and since the 1st number is not equal to the 2nd number so the output is True.
# The 3rd output is giving the answer false, this is because the operation to be carried out is Greater than operation and since the 1st number is not geater than the 2nd number so the 0utput is false.
#  The 4th output is giving the answer True, this is becuse the operation to be carried out is Less than operation and since the 1st number is less than the 2nd number so the output is True.
